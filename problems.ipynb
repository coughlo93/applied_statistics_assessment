    "\n",
    "In this notebook, I will extend the Lady Tasting Tea experiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Original Fisher design: 8 cups total (4 tea-first, 4 milk-first).\n",
    "- Extended design: 12 cups total (8 tea-first, 4 milk-first).\n",
    "\n",
    "A participant claims they can tell, for each cup, whether the milk or tea was poured first.  \n",
    "We want to estimate, by simulation, the probability that a participant with no real ability (i.e. just guessing) correctly identifies all cups in each design.\n",
    "\n",
    "I will:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Simulate the experiment many times using numpy.\n",
    "2. Estimate the probability of perfectly identifying all cups by chance in:\n",
    "   - The original 8-cup experiment.\n",
    "   - The extended 12-cup experiment.\n",
    "3. Compare the estimated probabilities and discuss what this means for p-values and evidence against the null hypothesis."
